                <p>The journey to Whispering Manor was long and <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) involving or requiring strenuous effort; difficult and tiring.">arduous</span>, requiring a lot of effort and being very tiring. When Elara finally arrived, the manor loomed before her, a <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) enormous.">gargantuan</span> structure, absolutely huge and imposing. Its architecture was a <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a number of different things, parts or items that are grouped together; collection.">conglomeration</span>, a mixture of various styles, from Gothic spires to Victorian turrets, making it look both grand and slightly <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) lacking any obvious principle of organization.">haphazard</span>, or disorganized. The grounds were somewhat <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a building or object) in a state of disrepair or ruin as a result of age or neglect.">dilapidated</span>, in a state of disrepair from neglect, with overgrown gardens that hinted at a once-magnificent past.</p>
                <p>An elderly, <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a person) lean and haggard, especially because of suffering, hunger, or age.">gaunt</span> butler, so thin he looked almost skeletal, greeted her. His name was Mr. Filbert, and his manner was <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a person) reserved or uncommunicative in speech; saying little.">taciturn</span>, meaning he was reserved and said very little. He led Elara through <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a network) like a labyrinth; irregular and twisting.">labyrinthine</span> corridors, a complex and confusing network of passages, where portraits with <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) causing one to feel unsettled.">disconcerting</span> eyes, eyes that made her feel uneasy, seemed to follow her every move. The air was thick with the smell of old wood and something else, something faintly sweet and <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) extremely delicate and light in a way that seems not to be of this world.">ethereal</span>, meaning delicate and light, as if not of this world.</p>
                <p>Finally, they reached a vast library. Bookshelves, heavy with <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) large, heavy, scholarly books.">tomes</span> – large, scholarly books – stretched to the ceiling. In the centre, by a crackling fireplace, sat an old woman with eyes as bright and <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) having a ready insight into and understanding of things.">perspicacious</span> as a hawk's, showing she had a sharp ability to understand things quickly. This, Elara knew, had to be Great-Aunt Callista. She was not as <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) unfriendly or threatening in appearance.">forbidding</span>, or unfriendly and threatening, as Elara had imagined. Instead, she had an air of <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) the quality of having or showing great knowledge or learning; scholarship.">erudition</span>, great knowledge acquired by study, and a mischievous twinkle in her eye.</p>
                <p>"Welcome, Elara," Callista said, her voice surprisingly <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a person's voice or other sound) imposingly deep and full.">sonorous</span>, full and deep in sound. "I trust your journey wasn't too <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a task or responsibility) involving a great deal of effort, trouble, or difficulty.">onerous</span>, too burdensome or troublesome?"</p>
                <p>Elara, a little <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) bewildered or perplexed.">flummoxed</span>, or completely bewildered, by the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) splendour and impressiveness, especially of appearance or style.">grandeur</span> and the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) strange or odd; unusual.">peculiar</span> atmosphere, just nodded.</p>
                <p>"Good," Callista continued. "We have much to <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) speak or write authoritatively about a topic. (n) written or spoken communication or debate.">discourse</span> upon, to talk about at length. The inheritance I mentioned is not <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) relating to money or currency.">monetary</span>, not about money, child. It is… a legacy of a different kind, one that requires a <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) having or showing keen mental discernment and good judgement; wise or shrewd.">sagacious</span> mind, a mind that is wise and shows good judgement."</p>
                <p>Callista gestured towards a small, <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) elaborately or highly decorated.">ornate</span> box, elaborately decorated, on a nearby table. "The first part of your <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) difficult to interpret or understand; mysterious.">enigmatic</span> inheritance lies within. But it will not <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) produce or provide (a natural, agricultural, or industrial product); give way to arguments, demands, or pressure.">yield</span> its secrets <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adv) in a way that is subject to sudden, unaccountable changes of mood or behaviour.">capriciously</span>, or on a sudden whim. You must prove yourself."</p>
                <p>The <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a network) like a labyrinth; irregular and twisting.">labyrinthine</span> nature of the house itself seemed to mirror the complexity of the task ahead.</p>

                <p>Great-Aunt Callista explained that the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) elaborately or highly decorated.">ornate</span> box contained a <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a confusing and difficult problem or question.">conundrum</span>, a confusing and difficult problem or question. "This family," she began, her <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) having a ready insight into and understanding of things.">perspicacious</span> eyes fixed on Elara, "has always been <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) consist of; be made up of.">comprised</span> of <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) people who have responsibility for taking care of or protecting something.">custodians</span>, keepers or guardians, of ancient knowledge. This knowledge is not for the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) not having any serious purpose or value.">frivolous</span>, those who are not serious or sensible."</p>
                <p>Elara, feeling a mixture of <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a feeling of fear or anxiety about something that may happen.">trepidation</span>, a feeling of fear that something bad might happen, and intense curiosity, examined the box. It was made of a dark, unfamiliar wood, inlaid with mother-of-pearl in patterns that looked like star constellations – the very subject she had been <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) reading or examining something carefully.">perusing</span>! There were no visible locks or hinges. It seemed <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) impossible to pass through or enter.">impenetrable</span>, impossible to get through or into.</p>
                <p>"The key is not physical," Callista hinted, a sly smile playing on her lips. "It is <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) of the cerebrum of the brain; intellectual rather than emotional or physical.">cerebral</span>, related to the intellect and brain. You must <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) convert (a text written in code, or a coded signal) into normal language.">decipher</span> the clues, convert the coded message into normal language. Consider your passions, Elara. Consider what you were doing before that <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) characterized by pretentious or showy display; designed to impress.">ostentatious</span> owl, that showy bird, so <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adv) with a lack of courtesy; roughly or abruptly.">unceremoniously</span>, or rudely and abruptly, interrupted you."</p>
                <p>Elara's mind raced. The constellations! She remembered the book she was reading, specifically a chapter on <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a story or statement) of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true.">apocryphal</span> tales, stories of doubtful authenticity but widely circulated as true, about hidden messages within star patterns. She recalled a particularly <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) not discovered or known about; uncertain.">obscure</span> legend, one not well-known, about the "Celestial Cartographer's Cipher."</p>
                <p>"The stars..." Elara whispered, her eyes lighting up with <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) in an initial stage; beginning to happen or develop.">incipient</span> understanding, an understanding just beginning to develop. She traced the patterns on the box, realizing they weren't random. They depicted a specific, albeit <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) belonging to a period other than that being portrayed.">anachronistic</span> – belonging to an earlier period and out of place in the present – map of the night sky.</p>
                <p>With growing confidence, Elara began to press the stars in a sequence described in the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of a story or statement) of doubtful authenticity, although widely circulated as being true.">apocryphal</span> legend she'd read. There was a soft click. A tiny drawer, previously <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) impossible to perceive.">imperceptible</span>, or impossible to see, slid open. Inside, nestled on velvet, was not a jewel, but another <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a stiff, flat, thin material made from the prepared skin of an animal, formerly used as a durable writing surface.">parchment</span>, even older and more <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) hard but liable to break easily.">brittle</span>, or easily broken, than the first. It contained a single, <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) (of speech or writing) using or involving ellipsis, especially so as to be difficult to understand; ambiguous.">elliptical</span> sentence, one that was <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(adj) open to more than one interpretation; having a double meaning.">ambiguous</span> and deliberately vague: "Where light fears to tread, <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) the quality of having experience, knowledge, and good judgement.">wisdom</span>'s echo is bred."</p>
                <p>Callista chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. "Well done, child. Your <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) the ability to make good judgements and take quick decisions.">acumen</span>, your ability to make good judgements and quick decisions, is promising. But this is merely the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) an action or event serving as an introduction to something more important.">prelude</span>, an introduction to something more significant."</p>
                <p>Elara felt a surge of <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a feeling of excitement, happiness, or elation.">exhilaration</span>, a feeling of great happiness and excitement. The <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) a confusing and difficult problem or question.">conundrum</span> was far from solved, but she had unlocked the first step.</p>

                <p>Just as panic began to <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(v) begin to grow or increase rapidly; flourish.">burgeon</span>, to grow and flourish, Elara’s fingers brushed against something smooth and cool on the pedestal beside the <span class="hard-word" data-definition="(n) the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge; a dictionary.">lexicon</span>.
